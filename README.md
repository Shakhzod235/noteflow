# 🧠 Noteflow

**Noteflow** is a lightweight fullstack note-taking application with nested folders, markdown support, and an optional backend built with Express.js.  
It’s designed as a personal project to explore real-world React architecture, global state management with Zustand, **server communication via React Query**, and modular feature-based design.
